Briana's Quiz App

As a software engineer student working in a totally different industry during the course of my studies, I sometimes have the tendencie to not retain important imformation as pertaining to software engineering or even basic computer science in general.
This quiz app is targeted to having an on-the-go quizlet to help those like me who need a refresher throughout the day when unable to work on class assignments and projects, but don't want to completely forget certain basic knowledge as related to the tech industry.  All of the questions in this quiz app are computer science specific, and serve as impromptu study guides made fun!
